        <td style="width:90%; text-align: left;">In the glimmering city of stars, where dreams are born and fantasies
            come alive, there lived a renowned Hollywood actress named Evangeline Parrish. With eyes that reflected the
            vastness of the universe, and a smile that could bewitch even the moon, she held audiences captive with her
            ethereal performances.</br></br>Amidst the luxury and glamour of Tinseltown, Evangeline found solace in the
            arms of a mysterious lover named Tristan. His aura was enigmatic, his allure unmatched. Little did
            Evangeline know that her beloved Tristan carried a secret—a secret that transcended time itself. For Tristan
            was a time traveler, a dark wizard who manipulated the threads of the past, present, and future.</br></br>
            One fateful evening, as Evangeline eagerly awaited the opening night of her latest blockbuster, a messenger
            from the outer galaxy arrived with an urgent missive. The messenger, a being of luminescent beauty and
            wisdom, revealed that a celestial prophecy foretold the birth of a child destined to be a powerful magician,
            capable of shaping the fate of entire galaxies.</br></br>Stunned by this revelation, Evangeline's heart
            skipped a beat, for she knew deep within her being that this child was none other than her own.</br></br>In
            the midst of the Hollywood chaos, a child was born. Bathed in the radiance of the moonlight, the newborn
            possessed an aura that blended magic and stardust. Evangeline named her son Orion, a name befitting
            the celestial destiny that awaited him.</br></br>As Orion grew, her magical abilities became apparent.
            He possessed an innate power to bend reality, to weave spells through the mere flick of his wrist.
            Evangeline, Tristan, and Seraphina formed a bond like no other – a union of love, magic, and untold
            possibilities.</br></br>Yet, as their journey progressed, the pull of different galaxies and dimensions
            threatened to tear them apart. Evangeline's luminous career in Hollywood demanded her presence while
            Tristan, bound by the realm of time, was compelled to fulfill his duties as a time traveler.</br></br>
            However, true love would not allow fate to be so cruel. In a final act of defiance, Eva and Tristan set out
            on a quest to unite the realms of Hollywood and the outer galaxy, defying time and space to form an eternal
            bond.</br></br>And thus, their tale became etched in the stars—a tale of a Hollywood actress, her lover, a
            time-traveling dark wizard, and a messenger with news from distant galaxies. A tale where their child,
            Orion, adorned the mantle of a magician and orchestrated a symphony of cosmic proportions.</br></br>In
            the end, love conquered all, and the universe bore witness to the epic love story of Evangeline, Tristan,
            and Orion—a story that shall echo through the ages, captivating the hearts of those enchanted by tales
            of magic, stardust, and undying love.
