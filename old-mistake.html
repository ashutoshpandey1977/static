        <td style="text-align: left;">In a realm where magic intertwines with time,</br>There lived a dark
            wizard, harboring secrets sublime.</br>With powers that twisted and turned through the night,</br>His heart
            filled with mischief, his intentions not quite right.</br></br>Yet deep within his core, a love did
            reside,</br>A wife, a Hollywood actress, forever by his side.</br>Their love like a tapestry, woven strong
            and wide,</br>Together, they dreamed of forever, side by side.</br></br>But alas, in pursuit of his dark,
            twisted ways,</br>The wizard made a mistake, lingering for countless days.</br>His conscience weighed heavy,
            his soul filled with remorse,</br>He knew he must rewind time, to rectify his course.</br></br>Leaving his
            wife and young son behind,</br>He embarked on a quest, a journey to rewind.</br>Back to a time where his
            mistake was made,</br>To rewrite history, to fix the life that had frayed.</br></br>Yet as he traveled
            through the portal, time torn asunder,</br>An evil sorcerer awaited, plotting a spell of thunder.</br>A
            wicked soccer, enchanted and vile,</br>Yearned to bind the dark wizard, force him to beguile.</br></br>In
            the past, as the wizard emerged,</br>The evil soccer cast its spell, now fully submerged.</br>Forced to
            commit unspeakable deeds,</br>Darkness clouded his mind, his soul in twisted weeds.</br></br>But deep within
            his memories, love's essence remained,</br>His wife and young son, their faces unrestrained.</br>Through the
            chaos and torment, their love burned bright,</br>Awakening his heart, guiding him to see the
            light.</br></br>With every step he took, a battle he waged,</br>Against the evil spell, as time continued to
            age.</br>He fought with his magic, and with every breath,</br>To break free from the sorcerer's
            hex.</br></br>In his darkest moments, love became his guide,</br>Guiding him toward redemption, casting evil
            aside.</br>With a resolve unyielding, he shattered the fetter,</br>Reclaiming his identity, his soul made
            whole and better.</br></br>Returning to the present, with lessons learned,</br>The dark wizard knew his wife
            he must yearn.</br>He vowed to make amends, to cherish every day,</br>Never to stray again, never to go
            astray.</br></br>He sought forgiveness from his wife's loving glow,</br>And their son, whose innocence
            started to grow.</br>Together, they rebuilt the love that was bruised,</br>A family bound by love that could
            never be diffused.</br></br>And so, the dark wizard transformed his ways,</br>Harnessing his powers to bring
            light through the gray.</br>Love triumphed over darkness, redemption was found,</br>In a magical realm where
            love's magic did abound.
