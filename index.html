        <td width=90%><p>Once upon a time, in the shimmering realm of Hollywood, there lived a wizard whose mother was a renowned actress.
        She exuded beauty and grace, captivating the hearts of audiences with every film she starred in. The young
        wizard, named Orion, possessed the same enchanting aura as his mother and possessed powers that rivaled even the
        most mystical beings in existence.</br></br>Orion grew up under the shimmering lights of the silver screen, his
        mother's career paving his path towards greatness. But little did he know that fate had a darker, more
        treacherous plan in store for him. One fateful summer evening, as the sunset dipped beneath the horizon, tragedy
        struck the shores of a beautiful beach.</br></br>It was there, by the crashing waves and golden sands, that
        Orion's mother encountered her doom. The serial killer, known for his twisted obsession with their family, had
        stalked her every move, seducing her with his deceitful charm. In a moment of vulnerability and love, she chose
        to trust him, unaware of the horrifying truth hidden beneath his charming facade.</br></br>As the sun slipped
        away, darkness swallowed the beach, and the chilling night air was pierced by a scream that echoed through the
        depths of Orion's being. Rushing to the scene, he arrived just in time to witness the life drain from his
        mother's eyes, the flames of her magical spirit fading before him.</br></br>Consumed by grief and fueled by his
        powers, Orion vowed to avenge his mother's untimely death. He delved deep into the arcane arts, pushing his
        magical abilities to their limits. The once-charming actor became a relentless hunter, tracking the footsteps of
        the wicked killer who had stolen his mother from him.</br></br>Guided by the whispers of celestial winds and
        guided by the moonlit path, Orion embarked on a quest to bring justice to the realm of Hollywood. He unraveled
        the dark secrets that lay dormant beneath the glamour and glitter, uncovering a labyrinth of deception that
        pushed his very soul to its limits.</br></br>With each passing day, Orion grew stronger, harnessing the power of
        his grief and turning it into an unstoppable force. As he closed in on the killer, their cat-and-mouse chase
        escalated, taking them through hidden alleyways, backlots, and forgotten dungeons that lay hidden behind the
        glitz and glamour.</br></br>Finally, bathed in the pale light of a moonlit night, Orion cornered his mother's
        murderer in an old, forgotten theater. The killers' eyes widened with fear as the young wizard released a
        torrent of raw energy, each spellformed with the intensity of his burning rage. The battle that unfolded was a
        clash of ancient forces, the culmination of Orion's unwavering determination and the killer's malevolent
        darkness.</br></br>In the end, it was love and justice that triumphed. Orion's spells twisted and twirled like
        fiery serpents, delivering the justice his mother deserved. The beach witnessed not only the demise of the
        wicked soul, but also the rebirth of a weary but resilient wizard.</br></br>As dawn broke over the horizon,
        Orion stood amidst the wreckage, carrying the memories of his beloved mother within his heart. The realm of
        Hollywood would never be the same again, for a wizard had placed a final spell upon it, ensuring that no
        darkness could linger while he was still one with the world.</br></br>And so, the story of Orion, the wizard son
        of a Hollywood actress, became legend, whispered from one star to another, whispered from one generation to the
        next.</p> </td>
