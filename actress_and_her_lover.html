            <td style="text-align: left;"><div class="story"> In the glimmering lights of Hollywood,</br>A tale unfolds, both magical and good,</br>A
                captivating actress, her rise so supreme,</br>And a time-traveling dark wizard, with an extraordinary
                dream.</br></br>She graced the silver screen with beauty and charm,</br>Her talent unraveled, causing
                hearts to alarm,</br>But amidst the limelight, there was a longing unknown,</br>A desire for more, for a
                love so uniquely shown.</br></br>Within the shadows, a dark wizard did reside,</br>Manipulating time,
                with powers he couldn't hide,</br>His heart, burdened with a love he thought he would conceal,</br>For
                he dared not reveal the depths of what he truly feel.</br></br>Fate intervened, bringing these two souls
                together,</br>As chance encounters led to a love that would tether,</br>Their worlds colliding, a love
                that defied reality,</br>As the actress and wizard embarked on a journey of totality.</br></br>With a
                flicker of magic, the wizard unveiled his secret,</br>A time-traveling soccer, a relic of mystique,</br>
                He gifted it to her, knowing the power it possessed,</br>To change her destiny, her fame to be
                addressed.</br></br>With each kick of the ball, she transcended time,</br>Her performances caught the
                world in a bewildered chime,</br>The actress enchanted audiences in past and present,</br>Guided by her
                dark wizard, her love so fervent.</br></br>She soared through eras, from the roaring twenties,</br>To
                the swing of the forties, steady and plenty,</br>Her name whispered on everyone's lips,</br>Her
                performances, like magic, her audience grips.</br></br>Every twist and turn, woven effortlessly,</br>
                Their love stood strong, defying all adversity,</br>But as time would have it, it's a demanding
                force,</br>And their love was challenged along its remorse.</br></br>The actress longed for a life of
                normalcy,</br>To be free from endless traveling and celebrity,</br>But the wizard, bound by his dark
                duties,</br>Would struggle to find a way to grant her such wishes.</br></br>In desperation, he sought
                the help of his kin,</br>Others who wielded magic, consumed by sin,</br>Together, they crafted a potion,
                a timeless spell,</br>That would forever bind the actress to the wizard's spell.</br></br>Yet, when the
                moment came to cast the enchantment,</br>The actress hesitated, her heart in torment,</br>For she
                realized her love for the wizard was true,</br>And a life without him, she simply couldn't
                pursue.</br></br>With a heavy heart, she turned her back on fame,</br>Choosing a love she knew would
                never fade or wane,</br>And as the wizard's powers diminished through the years,</br>Their love,
                stronger than ever, stood devoid of fears.</br></br>Years passed, in a quiet life they found their
                bliss,</br>With their love as radiant as a lover's tender kiss,</br>And though the actress remained away
                from the silver screen,</br>She lived a life more fulfilling than she had ever dreamed.</br></br>And so,
                the tale of the Hollywood actress and her lover,</br>A dark wizard, with his magical powers to
                discover,</br>Teaches us that love can conquer space and time,</br>That even in darkness, a love so pure
                can truly shine."</div></td>
